# Cloud-based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative System

We take advantage of the `Paillier Threshold Encryption Toolbox` `http://www.cs.utdallas.edu/dspl/cgi-bin/pailliertoolbox/index.php` to implement the system.

There are two class files `TestUFS.java` and `TestCSS.java` in `stage_threshold` package, which respectively test the performances of `Privacy-Preserving Uncapacitated Facility Sharing` protocol and `Privacy-Preserving Communal Service Sharing` protocol.
